# Assignment 1 - Webpage in Vanilla JS

**The Komputer Store**

In this Assignment I have created a Webpage with HTML, CSS & Vanilla JS. The website has four components Users Bank Account, Users Work Account, PC Selection and Finally Detail View of Selected PC.

### Users Bank Account

Here You Can See Name of User, Their Bank Account Balance and Button to Take Loan Which Will Open a Prompt Asking For The Amount. When User Has a Active Loan There will Also Be a Line For Outstanding Amount Under the Account Balance.

### Users Work Account

Their Work Account Balance, How much they are owned by their employer. There are two buttons below, Bank will deposit the money into the bank account, if user have a active loan then 10% will automatically go towards down-payment while the rest is deposited. The Work button will increase the salary / owed amount by 100 for each press. If user has a outstanding loan a third button will appear, pressing that will make 100% of the amount to go towards down-payment with any remainder going to the bank account.

###  PC Selection

Here you have a dropdown menu over all of the products offered at this store, choosing a new product will update the website with corresponding information. Under the dropdown you get a spec sheet of selected product.

### Center View / Detail View

Here you get information about the selected product like Image, Title, Description, Price and the Option to buy the product by pressing the buy now button.
